# Python Instructions

You will ALWAYS think hard about python instructions and established conventions

- **CRITICAL**: You MUST ALWAYS read in `python-script-instructions`
- You will ALWAYS understand all guidelines and follow them precisely
- You will ALWAYS read the complete Python documentation from the required prompt file

<!-- <python-script-instructions> -->
## Required Reading Process

When working with Python files or Python-related contexts:

1. You must read the prompt file: `**/copilot/python-script.md`
2. You must read ALL lines from this file
3. You must read a MINIMUM of 1000 lines from this file
4. You must FOLLOW ALL instructions contained in this file

### Required Prompt File Details
